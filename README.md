# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — VSD
**Participant: India Cohort**

Welcome to my repo documenting my journey through the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**. This repository contains week-by-week logs of tasks, learnings, and progress as I work through the RTL → GDSII flow using open-source EDA tools.

---

## 📖 About the Program
This program teaches the end-to-end SoC design flow — from RTL to GDSII — using open-source tools and workflows. It is part of India’s large-scale collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, involving **3500+ participants** working to expand domestic silicon design capabilities.

## 📅 Week 0 — Environment Setup & Toolchain
| Task  | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Task 0 | 🛠️ Installed and configured **Icarus Verilog (iverilog), Yosys, and GTKWave** | ✅ Completed |

### 🌟 Week 0 — Key Takeaways
- Installed and validated the essential open-source EDA toolchain for RTL simulation and synthesis.
- Set up a reproducible development environment for further RTL → GDSII experiments.
- System is ready for synthesis, place-and-route, and downstream steps.
